The game will be a roguelike deckbuilding turn-based combat game. Instead of a deck of cards, however, players will have an army of mercenaries under their control in each battle.

Gameplay:
- Players start with a default army of ordinary mercenaries
- As they fight battles, they can find better mercenaries, upgrade their existing ones, and discover unique items that grant a variety of benefits
